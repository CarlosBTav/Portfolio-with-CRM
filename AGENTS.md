## Technology Decisions

### Frontend: Blade + Alpine.js

Laravel Breeze includes server-rendered Blade templates with Alpine.js for
lightweight interactivity. This is intentional; this is not a React or Vue SPA.

- **Advantages:** Simpler server-side logic, Laravel auth built in, less JS
  overhead.
- **Trade-off:** Full-page refreshes for navigation, which is acceptable for
  this admin tool.
- **Best for:** Content management systems and admin dashboards.

### Styling: Tailwind CSS 3

- Utility-first CSS framework.
- Vite integration through Tailwind tooling.
- Form styling through `@tailwindcss/forms`.

### Database: MySQL

- Structured relational data for clients, projects, messages, and contacts.
- Foreign key constraints.
- No NoSQL dependency is currently needed.

### Notifications

- Queue-based notification flow through Laravel Jobs.
- Telegram and WhatsApp notifier services are available.
- Redis can be added for production queue handling.

---

## Key Code Patterns

### Model Relationships

```php
public function technologies()
{
    return $this->belongsToMany(Technology::class);
}

public function contacts()
{
    return $this->hasMany(Contact::class);
}

public function client()
{
    return $this->belongsTo(Client::class);
}
```

### Form Validation

Form validation belongs in `app/Http/Requests/`. Keep controller methods focused
on workflow and persistence.

### Controller Pattern

Controllers follow standard Laravel resource naming:

- `index()` lists records.
- `create()` shows the create form.
- `store()` saves a new record.
- `show()` displays a record.
- `edit()` shows the edit form.
- `update()` saves changes.
- `destroy()` deletes a record.

### Service Layer

Reusable business logic belongs in services, such as
`app/Services/Notifications/TelegramNotifier.php` and
`app/Services/Notifications/WhatsAppNotifier.php`.

---

## Authentication And Authorization

- **Method:** Laravel Breeze, session-based.
- **Default:** Single admin user seeded in development.
- **Model:** `User` with Laravel guards.
- **Middleware:** `auth` is required on admin routes in `routes/web.php`.

---

## Database Seeding

Run this command to reset and seed development data:

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

This creates the default admin user, sample projects, clients, and technologies.
Be careful with this command outside development because it resets data.

Seeder files live in `database/seeders/`.

---

## Deployment Notes

### Environment Variables

Important `.env` values:

- `APP_URL`
- `DB_HOST`
- `DB_DATABASE`
- `MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS`
- Telegram and WhatsApp API keys, if notification services are enabled.

### Docker

The `compose.yaml` includes:

- Laravel app container, PHP 8.2.
- MySQL database.
- Optional services such as Redis, Memcached, and Milvus.

### Asset Pipeline

- Frontend assets are compiled with Vite.
- CSS is processed through Tailwind.
- JavaScript is bundled by Vite.
- Built files are placed in `public/build/`.

## Debugging Laravel 500 Errors

When a 500 appears, check logs and permissions before changing application code.

### Fast Diagnostic Checklist

1. Review `storage/logs/laravel.log`.
2. If the error mentions `Permission denied` in `storage/framework/views`,
   `storage/logs`, or `bootstrap/cache`, treat it as an ownership or writable
   permissions issue first.
3. Clear Laravel caches:

```bash
php artisan optimize:clear
php artisan view:clear
```

4. Retry the page.

### Recommended Local Permissions

From the project root in Linux, WSL, or Sail-oriented local environments:

```bash
sudo chown -R $USER:www-data storage bootstrap/cache
sudo chmod -R ug+rwx storage bootstrap/cache
find storage -type f -exec chmod 664 {} \;
find storage -type d -exec chmod 775 {} \;
find bootstrap/cache -type f -exec chmod 664 {} \;
find bootstrap/cache -type d -exec chmod 775 {} \;
```

Notes:

- Avoid `chmod -R 777` except for short, explicit diagnosis.
- With containers, confirm that the effective web-server user can write to
  `storage/` and `bootstrap/cache/`.

### Mixed Owners In `storage/framework/views`

If CLI commands compile Blade views as one user while PHP-FPM or Apache runs as
another user, compiled view files can be owned by the wrong account. A small
Blade edit then forces recompilation and Laravel may fail with
`file_put_contents(.../storage/framework/views/...): Permission denied`.

Stable fix:

```bash
sudo chown -R $USER:www-data storage bootstrap/cache
sudo chmod -R ug+rwx storage bootstrap/cache
php artisan view:clear
```

Quick cleanup when sudo is unavailable:

```bash
find storage/framework/views -maxdepth 1 -type f -name '*.php' ! -user www-data -delete
php artisan view:clear
```

Adjust `www-data` if the web-server user is different.

### Common 500 Causes

- Missing `.env` variables such as `APP_KEY`, DB config, or `APP_URL`.
- Missing dependencies in `vendor/` or `node_modules/`.
- Stale Laravel caches after `.env` or config changes.
- Pending migrations.
- Blade or PHP syntax errors.
- Storage or cache directories not writable by the web process.

### Recovery Commands

```bash
php artisan optimize:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan view:clear
php artisan route:clear
```

In Sail:

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail artisan optimize:clear
```

## Known Limitations And Future Improvements

### Current Gaps

1. **Image storage:** Uses local storage in `storage/app/public`; production may
   need S3 or another object store.
2. **Notifications:** Telegram and WhatsApp notifiers exist but may need
   endpoint verification.
3. **Email:** No custom email templates for notifications yet.
4. **Real-time:** Messages do not auto-refresh because WebSockets are not yet
   implemented.

### Recommended Enhancements

1. Add REST API routes under `/api/*` for mobile or external integrations.
2. Expand the PHPUnit test suite.
3. Add soft deletes on critical models.
4. Add Laravel Scout or another search layer for full-text search.
5. Implement Laravel Echo with Pusher or Soketi for real-time updates.
6. Add throttling middleware on the public contact form.
